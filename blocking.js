Blocking Operations
These operations halt the execution of JavaScript until they are completed. This usually involves I/O operations, such as reading files or making network requests. While a blocking operation is in progress, JavaScript cannot perform any other tasks, leading to delays and a poor user experience.


Non-Blocking Operations
These operations do not halt the execution of JavaScript. Instead, they initiate a task and allow the program to continue with other operations. When the task is finished, a callback function is executed to handle the result. Non-blocking operations are crucial for creating responsive and efficient applications.
